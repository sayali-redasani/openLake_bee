Beginning:
The film opens with a whimsical narration about the impossibility of bee flight, immediately establishing the movie's playful tone. We're introduced to Barry B. Benson, a recent college graduate bee who is already feeling stifled by the prospect of choosing one job for the rest of his life within the rigidly structured bee society of New Hive City. Barry, a bit of a free-thinker, feels an innate unease with the system, questioning its apparent perfection. His close friend Adam Flayman is content with the status quo, excited by the prospect of a single, defined path.

Barry and Adam are taken on a tour of Honex Industries, where honey is manufactured. The tour guide emphasizes the importance of each small task but stresses that bees are locked into their chosen role for life. This is a revelation to Barry, and he's horrified by the lack of choice and the monotonous nature of bee existence. He can't reconcile it with his desire for something more.

He is particularly captivated by the Pollen Jocks, the elite bees who venture outside the hive to collect nectar and pollen. Their lives seem adventurous and unpredictable. Despite warnings and the established order, Barry impulsively joins them on a mission, drawn by a desire for experience and purpose beyond his predetermined path.

Middle:

Barry's first trip outside the hive is a chaotic mix of awe and danger. He experiences the vastness of the world, encounters strange objects (like tennis balls), and is ultimately separated from the Jocks. He ends up in the apartment of Vanessa Bloome, a kind human florist who saves him from being squashed. Breaking the cardinal bee law against talking to humans, Barry strikes up a friendship with Vanessa.

Their unconventional friendship blossoms, fueled by a shared desire for more than what society dictates. They discuss their career aspirations and dreams, and Barry is especially intrigued by human society, or rather, the "crazy" way it operates, especially in regard to food. He discovers that humans are consuming bee-produced honey on a massive scale. This revelation shocks and angers him, as he views it as theft and exploitation.

Driven by a sense of injustice, Barry begins investigating the honey industry, leading him to a horrific discovery: vast, factory-like bee farms where bees are kept in miserable conditions, their honey stolen for human consumption. This fuels Barry's resolve to take action. He decides to sue the human race on behalf of all bees.

Barry gets the support of his friend Adam and Vanessa, and the legal battle begins. This section of the film becomes a satire on the legal system and corporate greed, showcasing humorous courtroom antics and outlandish scenarios, like Barry's cross-examination of Sting and Ray Liotta. He makes an impassioned plea to the jury to understand the importance of bees and their labor.

However, the case is complicated by a heated confrontation with Vanessa's ex-boyfriend Ken, and Adam accidentally stings the opposing lawyer which throws the case into doubt. He is deeply concerned about his friend, and realizes that he is the only one who can win this case. Barry realizes that their legal fight is about more than just honey.

End:

Just as Barry's case seems doomed, he discovers the human honey industry is using bee smokers. Barry manages to prove their use in court, and his testimony is deemed powerful enough that the jury finds in favor of the bees. The bees are victorious and all bee farming is shut down.

However, this victory leads to unintended consequences. With no need to work, the bees become directionless. Nature starts to wither, and without pollination, flowers begin to die, impacting the entire ecosystem. Barry realizes the vital role bees play in the world and that he made a terrible mistake by stopping all work.

Seeing Vanessa's passion for flowers, and realizing that his victory created this chaos, Barry goes to Pasadena to restore the natural balance. Together, Barry and Vanessa hatch a plan to re-pollinate the world by using the last surviving flowers at the Tournament of Roses Parade. Barry rallies the bees, and they work together to fly the plane carrying the last flowers back to New York, where they re-pollinate the dying plants of Central Park.

The film ends with the bee society restored and more balanced, the bees happy and working. They have learned the importance of their role in the world, and Barry’s perspective of working has evolved. Barry is working as a pollen jock and a lawyer who now champions animal rights. The final message is a complex one: bees are not only important as honey producers but as vital members of an ecosystem. There is a happy ending where the bees are back to working, and they found a new appreciation for the jobs they do. Barry finally found his place in life.
